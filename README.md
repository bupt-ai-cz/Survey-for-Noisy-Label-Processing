# Survey-for-Noisy-Label-Processing
This repo is the official implementation of our paper [Noisy Label Processing for Classification: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04159). 
In this survey, we comprehensively review the evolution of different deep learning approaches for noisy label combating in the image classification task.

We also explore the inner pattern of real-world label noise and propose an algorithm to generate a synthetic label noise pattern guided by real-world data.
